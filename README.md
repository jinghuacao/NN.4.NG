# ABSTRACT
The model explores using machine learning technic to perform deep learning on natural gas industry trends and consumer demands, and predict natural gas future prices movement. It experiments the possibility to use advanced computer algorithm in structural modeling to predict human behavior, such as the pricing of a cyclical commodity. It will also compare the model result from different machine learning algorithms, along with statistical modeling. Please see the details in model documents in the main directory.
